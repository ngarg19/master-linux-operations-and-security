# master-linux-operations-and-security
A break-fix-observe-learn pattern Linux project focused on system behavior, administration, operational resilience and security fundamentals.

This project documents my journey of deliberately breaking and fixing Linux systems to build a deep operational and security mindset.

### Core Philosophy
- Break systems intentionally
- Observe behavior and logs
- Recover calmly
- Document lessons clearly

### Why this matters
Strong detection, cloud security, and incident response skills all originate from system-level understanding.

This repository evolves continuously as I build deeper intuition across Linux operations, networking, and security.
